## Instructions

Here, we provide some tools to brighten the dataset as described in the paper.
```
python LIME.py
python ying.py
python histogram_equalization.py
python gamma_intensity_correction.py
```

We also provide the script for extracting optical flow, ported from the [opencv-python tutorial](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d4/dee/tutorial_optical_flow.html)
